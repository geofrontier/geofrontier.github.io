      <h2>Internet and Network Troubleshooting</h2>
      <p> Use a home/personal network</p>
      <p> Check your internet connection: Verify that you can visit other websites without issues.</p>
      <p> Pause other network traffic: Stop software downloads, video streams, or network-heavy tasks on your gaming device</p>
      <p> Check your internet speed: Run an internet provider recommended speed test to check your internet connection speed and latency.</p>
      <p> Verify wireless connection strength: If you’re playing on a wireless network, try moving your gaming device closer to your router.</p>
      <p> Allow Minecraft through your firewall or VPN: If you have a firewall, antivirus software, or are using a VPN, check the settings to be sure that it is not blocking or slowing your connection.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>List of Errors</h2>
      <p> 
<strong>Connection refused: connect</strong>
- Confirm you’ve entered the correct server address. If it still doesn’t work, restart your router, flush your DNS, and tweak your firewall, antivirus, or proxy settings.

<strong>Creeper/ Error Code 221000</strong>
- Ensure your internet connection is stable and working properly

<strong>Crossbow</strong>
- Close the game completely (ensure it isn’t running in the background either) and let it sit idle for around two minutes before starting it again.

<strong>End of stream</strong>
- Restart the application.

<strong>Haybale</strong>
- This indicates an Xbox authorization error. First, ensure the Xbox app is up to date. If it is, log out of your account and sign in again.

<strong>Failed to login: Bad Login</strong>
- Ensure the version of Minecraft you’re running is the same as the server. If it is, disconnect your wifi, wait a few minutes, and try again.

<strong> Failed to login: invalid IP</strong>
- This will either be an internal service error or an error related to your internet. If it’s the former, you’ll have to wait a while; if it’s your internet, you’ll have to troubleshoot it.

<strong> Failed to login: the authentication servers are currently down for maintenance</strong>
- Ensure your firewall isn’t causing issues by disabling it temporarily and trying again. If it still doesn’t work and your internet is working fine, then you’ll have to wait for the maintenance to be over.

<strong> This server responded with an invalid server key</strong>
- Two things might cause this. Either the server you’re connecting to is outdated, in which case you won’t be able to connect to it, or you will have to log in again.

<strong> Took too long to log in</strong>
- Most likely, your internet speed is either too slow or too inconsistent.


<strong> Failed to check session lock, aborting</strong>
- Go to the session folder and look for a file that says “.lock’. Delete it and try again.

<strong> Code – 805306369</strong>
- This usually happens because of a lack of memory in your system. Try making more space by deleting stuff or closing some background applications.

<strong> Code – 1073740940</strong>
- Allocate more RAM to the Java Virtual Machine that’s running the game. You’ll have to buy more if you don’t have RAM available.

<strong> Code – 1073740791</strong>
- Update all of your drivers, and this error code should go away.

<strong> Code: – 1073741819</strong>
- This error code is exclusive to Nvidia drivers. You’ll either have to get them updated automatically or manually from the Nvidia website.

<strong> Game Ended with Bad State: Exit Code 1</strong>
- Update JAVA, update all your drivers, and finally, update Minecraft. If the issue remains, uninstall the game and then reinstall it.

<strong> java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</strong>
- Allocate more RAM to the Java Virtual Machine that’s running the game. If you don’t have RAM available, then you’ll have to buy more.

<strong> RuntimeException: No OpenGL context found in the current thread.</strong>
- Ensure your drivers are up to date. If they are, you’ll likely have to get a better graphics card, as the current one is too weak.
